### Coding directions

For this assignment you will choose any one of the Programming Assignments you have completed and implement it in another language besides Python. 

### Functions implemented

- Assignment 2: Bubble Sort Radix Sort
- Language chosen to compare: JavaScript

### Visualiztion 

- Created four CanvasJS graphs to compare:
    - Python: Bubble Sort vs Radix Sort average time per iteration.
    - JavaScript: Bubble Sort vs Radix Sort average time per iteration.
    - Python vs JavaScript: Bubble Sort average per iteration.
    - Python vs JavaScript: Radix Sort average per iteration.

### Benchmarking

- Each graph holds ten data points. 
- Each data point represents various datasets ranging from 500-40000 elements.
- Each dataset is randomized.
- Each dataset runs 10 iterations and takes the average run time per iteration.
